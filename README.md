# The project uses the API of <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">haveibeenpwned.com</a> to collect the data of the breached passwords.the password is given to the code through the terminal the website needs the password in hash format so the build in shalibrary of python is used to convert the code into SHA1-hash the hashed number is split into two parts to secure our password and not completely giving our password to the website the first 5 letters of the hash are sent to the website to check whether there is any password with same first 5 numbers breached if breached it will also return the count of how many times the password was breached. then the code will check for the exact match of the remaining part of the split hash if the hash matches to the returned value the code will inform us that our password was breached in a data breach.
